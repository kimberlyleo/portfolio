    "aboutme":"I am currently studying at LEARN Academy, an intensive Full-Stack bootcamp where I work with React.js & Ruby on Rails with Postgresql. During this time I have been learning TDD and getting addicted to the wizardry that is coding. I am switching to dev from being a professional Brewer because I am passionate about learning new technologies and being consistently challenged. Coding gives us incredible power to communicate effectively with the world! I am currently diving deeper into creating mobile apps with React Native; next up: D3 and Python. I believe that with the combination of hardwork, dynamic collaboration, and code anything becomes possible.",
